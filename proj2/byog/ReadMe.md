# World Generation Project.
# CS61B - Project 2.

In this project, I have designed and implemented a 2D tile-based game.

In the first part of the project I have created a world generator (pseudorandomly generated), which means that when every time the user starts the game, the world is 
generated randomly every time it looks diiferent and random.

In the second part of the project I have added interactivity in the game, in which the player can move in the world and take points or be destroyed by the monster.

Rules of The game: 
- When the user starts the game, he has to move in the world and collect all the flowers in it and then go to the yellow locked door without being touched
 by the monster. If the monster touched the player, the player would lose.

- The game difficulty changes every round. Every round, the monster speed increases and when the player reaches half the game (round 5) another monster appear
and the game becomes more difficult.
