# Planet Simulation.
# CS61B - Project 0

I have written a program simulating the motion of N objects in a plane,accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newtonâ€™s Law of Universal Gravitation.
In brief, I have created a program NBody.java that draws an animation of bodies floating around in space tugging on each other with the power of gravity.
